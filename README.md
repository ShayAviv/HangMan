## 🕹️ **What is Hangman Madness?**

**Hangman Madness** is a bold, creative, and hilariously fun take on the classic word-guessing game we all know and love! Dive into the world of ASCII art, witty banter, and the thrill of guessing the right word before your little stick figure friend meets his untimely end!

---

## ✨ **Features**

- 🎨 **Stylish ASCII Art**: Watch as your stickman gradually materializes (or not!) based on your guesses.
- 🧠 **Mind-Boggling Word Challenges**: With a custom word selection mechanism, no two games are ever the same.
- 😎 **Cheeky Feedback**: Incorrect guesses? Be ready for some playful roasting!
- 🎯 **Interactive Gameplay**: Real-time feedback on your progress, keeping the tension high.

1. **Enter your name** to get a personalized greeting.
2. **Select a word** from a text file by providing the file path and index.
3. **Start guessing letters** and watch your stickman grow!
4. **Win** by guessing the word before the stickman is fully drawn.
5. **Lose** and get taunted, but don’t worry—you can always try again!
